### Plex User IP Registration
This is a lightweight Docker container that hosts a website that shows an overview of IP addresses used by your Plex users. It gathers this data from the Tautulli RESTful API. This data is then stored within an onboard SQLite database.

This project is completely generated via ChatGPT. I am making this project with very basic programming skills.
